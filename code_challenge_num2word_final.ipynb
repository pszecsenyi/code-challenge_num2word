There is one overarching pattern: you always have hundreds, twenties and ones, which are combined with thousands, millions, billions, etc: one new 'type' for every additional 3 digits. But the hundreds, twenties and ones always come back and we always write them the same way. Therefore one idea to construct the function is to build one subfunction num000 that spells out the hundreds, twenties and ones correctly and another subfunction num2word that loops over num000 to bring in the additional layer of thousands, millions, billions, etc.. depending on the original input."
